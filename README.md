Emory 10am class, teaching the undergrads how to use Git and GitHub.

Insert poetry here:


“In a Station of the Metro” by Ezra Pound

The apparition of these faces in the crowd;

Petals on a wet, black bough.


2nd poem

Joyce Clement “Birds Punctuate the Days”

Period

One blue egg all summer long

Now gone


3rd poem
Ravi Shankar “Lines on a Skull”

life’s little, our heads

sad. Redeemed and wasting clay

this chance. Be of use.


Happy Spring Break!
